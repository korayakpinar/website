# The Truth Post: True and Important News

## What

The first decentralized newsletter with trustlessly curated content, powered by [Prove Me Wrong](/projects/prove-me-wrong).
The incentive mechanism will incentivize reporters to make news that resonates with communities' interests and is **fake-free**.
All happening in a **credibly neutral** decentralized process thanks to decentralized dispute resolution and game theory.

## Why

1. The right to access information and freedom of speech is not honored enough by the news we have now.
2. To incentivize news that is aligned with readers' interests.
3. Fake news is a problem and centralized fact-checking is another problem.
4. Intermediaries are taking lion's share of news reporting revenues.

## How

1. Anonymized: reporters can remain anonymous to exercise freedom of speech without endangering themselves.
2. Incentivized: reporters are incentivized to report news that resonate with the communities' interests.
3. Credibly-neutral: fact-checking and curation is decentralized, eliminating trust requirement.
4. Direct: reporters deliver directly to reader, no intermediaries to feed.

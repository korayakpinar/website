## Prove Me Wrong: Curating Falsifiable Statements

In economics, a public good is a good that is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous. For such goods, users cannot be barred from accessing or using them for failing to pay for them. Also, use by one person neither prevents access of other people nor does it reduce availability to others. In this sense, information is a public good. It's non-rivalrous: someone's consumption of a fact doesn't prevent others from consuming it. And it's non-excludable: one can consume a fact even if they haven't paid for it.

### Verifiability vs Falsifiability

Distributing information is in the public interest, provided that it is not mixed with misinformation. But how do we filter out misinformation? One way is to verify the statement. Verifying, however, is impractical since many statements, if not most, in daily life are infeasible to verify. One famous example is the following statement: all swans are white. Proving that "All swans are white" would logically require observing all swans, which is infeasible.

In contrast, observing a single black swan is sufficient to falsify the claim logically. So it is more practical to look for a refutation instead of a proof. But how to know if a black swan (refutation) will be observed eventually? We can't certainly know this unless we saw all swans, and we don't need to know it to be confident about the statement because we can estimate its likelihood. And this is what PMW is about: estimating the probability of [falsifiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability) statements (claims).

#### Decentralized Curation

Decentralized dispute resolution (like Kleros) enables decentralized curation solutions. And curation is much better when there is no central party to trust because you know an item in the curated list is not curated because the curator got bribed.

#### Claims

Let's categorize claims according to two features:

1. Difficulty of finding a proof
2. Difficulty of finding a counter-proof

##### Easy to Prove

If you claim that 1+1=2, you can hardly find anyone to object to that. And actually, you can simply bring your proof with you and you leave nothing to chance. There is nothing to solve here.

##### Impossible to Debunk

God is real. Proof? Nah. Can you prove otherwise? Nope. It's not productive to debate on this.

##### Difficult or Impossible to Prove But Much Easier to Debunk Claims

This category is interesting. We encounter such claims everyday, on newsletters, Twitter and television. People claim things that they can't prove. And they use this as an excuse for not providing proof. At the same time anyone can find a counter-proof and debunk the claim, provided that there is incentive to do so, as this requires labor.

A notable example is bug bounty programs. It's very difficult to prove that a piece of software is safe and secure so in order to gain the trust of the users, organizations issue bug bounty programs and invite everyone to prove that their software is not safe or not secure. After a significantly long time with a significantly big bounty, people start to become confident in this claim's chances to be true. At this point, the organization would argue that it's evident that there is no vulnerability, despite they can't prove it. This claim is not a truth at this point but it is a probabilistic truth with the likelihood of increasing every moment.

#### Should I Care?

You should care because this could be useful for a number of usecases.

- Bug Bounties (explained above)
- News
- Advertisements
- Political Campaigns

This project provides an effective way to gain trust of public.

### How

#### User Roles

##### Claimer

They make claims and put bounties on them.

##### Challengers

They hunt claims down for bounties.

##### Readers

They consume distilled information.

#### Claim Lifecycle

## Gazette Protocol: Launch Your Own Decentralized Gazette

### What

Make the rules, launch your gazette and let the community do the rest. The incentive mechanism will incentivize reporters to make news that resonates with communities' interests and is fake-free. Enjoy credibly neutral fact-checking and curation processes while you watch your gazette grow in content organically. Let people speculate on the future of your gazette and invest in it.

### Why

1. The right to access information and freedom of speech is not honored enough by the news we have now.
2. There is not enough incentive to make news in the public interest.
3. Fake news is a problem and centralized fact-checking is another problem.
4. Intermediaries are taking lion's share of news reporting revenues.

### How

A just-right mix of decentralized dispute resolution via Kleros and clever crypto-economic incentives. Details later.

# Gazette Protocol: Launch Your Own Decentralized Gazette

## What

This application of [Prove Me Wrong](/projects/prove-me-wrong) lets you make the rules, launch your gazette and let the community do the rest. The incentive mechanism will incentivize reporters to make news that resonates with communities' interests and is **fake-free**. Enjoy **credibly neutral fact-checking and curation** processes while you watch your gazette grow in content organically. Let people speculate on the future of your gazette and invest in it.

## Why

1. The right to access information and freedom of speech is not honored enough by the news we have now.
2. To incentivize news that is aligned with readers' interests.
3. Fake news is a problem and centralized fact-checking is another problem.
4. Intermediaries are taking lion's share of news reporting revenues.

## How

1. Anonymized: reporters can remain anonymous to exercise freedom of speech without endangering themselves
2. Incentivized: reporters are incentivized to report news that resonate with the communities' interests.
3. Decentralized: fact-checking and curation is decentralized, eliminating trust requirement.
4. Direct: reporters deliver directly to reader, no intermediaries to feed.

## What is This Good For?

This is good for creating any kind of online newsletter or magazine on any specific topic. But it can be especially useful for investigative journalism. Investigative journalism is critical for the functioning of democracy and markets. It's the costliest (consider efforts to reveal misconducts and the risks involved in revealing them) and least incentivized (despite it having the greatest societal value, reporting impactful news does not automatically translate to more revenues) form of journalism.

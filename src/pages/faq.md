## Prove Us Wrong? Prove Me Wrong? I'm confused.

Well, the initial project we were working on was Prove *Me* Wrong. Then we formed an organization and we choose an organization name, 
inspired by the name of the project plus a wordplay: Prove *Us* Wrong. So, one of them is the name of the organization the other one is 
the name of one of our projects.
